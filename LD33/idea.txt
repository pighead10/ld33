You are a vampire/werewolf/other monster that only is a monster when it is dark/moon/whatever
You do not want to be a monster
Have to balance trying to find a cure with not killing everyone when you turn into a monster

-Monster activates based on movement
-Can reposition blocks/etc to remove line of sight from guards
-Have to get to serum which cures you temporarily
-Limit on amount of people you can kill
-Guards kill you extremely quickly, killing them is sometimes necessary
